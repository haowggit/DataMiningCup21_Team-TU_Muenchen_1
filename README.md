# DataMiningCup21
Respository for the Data Mining Seminar SoSe 2021

In this branch you can find: \n
  scripts for preprocessing: preprocessing.py
  script for autoencoder: AutoEncoder.py and main.py
  script for SVD and tsne: SVD.py and manifold_learning.py
  one-hot encoded data of the attributes author, publisher, main topic of items dataset: OHE_sparse_matrix.npy and the corresponding col names as cols_OHE.csv
  
  Also tsne transformed data are stored. 

Note that OHE_sparse_matrix.npy stores a coo matirx. You need to import scipy.sparse first!
